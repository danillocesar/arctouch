The project was build using Spring Boot Framework  for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

For the backend, no third party libraries were used beside Spring boot that served as the rest api and service development.
For the front end the only third party that were used beside angular was the ngx-infinite-scroll to make use of a infinite scroll to show the upcoming movies without making pagination and the angular material to get a good looking UI

All the instructions are described inside the folders of each project.
