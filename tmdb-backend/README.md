You will need JDk 1.8 and maven installed to run this project.

Once you have all of this you can run the command mvn clean install inside the root folder of the project.

A folder named target will be created and inside it, you will find a file named tmdb-backend.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Open the command line and run the command java -jar tmdb-backend.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The server will start running and you can use the frontend project now.
